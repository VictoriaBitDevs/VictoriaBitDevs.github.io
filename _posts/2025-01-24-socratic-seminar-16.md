## Announcements
Please join us for our 16th socratic seminar in the city of Victoria. Please make sure you are RSVP'd, an identifier (but not a full name) is required for entry.

As a reminder, the ground rules of BitDevs are as follows:
- No photos, videos, or recordings
- [Chatham House Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule): share the information you receive, but do not reveal the identity of who said it
- Questions are encouraged, including basic ones!
- Socratic seminars are best when the moderator can let the conversation flow, so try to keep things concrete and focused

These rules exist so that BitDevs participants can speak freely within the event
